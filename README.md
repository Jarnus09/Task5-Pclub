There is a problem with adam optimizer method. The error is oscillating around 87 percent. Rest, in the past 4 days I have tried to create a neural network from scratch and also tried to implement all the features which have been asked. I had studied the backpropagation algorithm in my project work but I had to look up some references to actually implement it along with the optimizer approaches. I have also implemented the error function in the code. All in all, I have completed the basic model of the neural network but I was not able to implement the save command for saving the pickled model and the representation of error in 100 steps.
